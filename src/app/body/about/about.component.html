    <div id="about-text">
        I am currently a Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments and a proud graduate from the University of North Texas with a
        Bachelorâ€™s of Business Administration in Finance. My Finance degree and business knowledge has allowed me to better
        bridge gaps between business and technology. This knowledge afforded me to have a perspective that allows me to communicate
        ideas between different stakeholders of the software development life cycle. Since I began working at Fidelity Investments,
        I have had the opportunity to work in different lines of business where I worked on applications that had different
        technology stacks yet interfaced within the same development ecosystem. Each application brought its own set of experiences
        that gave me new ways to approach a problem. I feel that over the course of my time in the industry, I have refined
        my versatility and have become technology agnostic. I welcome the challenges my next endeavors will bring and hope
        they are as enriching as my last.
